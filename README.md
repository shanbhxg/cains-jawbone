The Cain's Jawbone is a 100-page book. The paragraphs are not in order, and the book is not paginated. The challenge is to read the book in the correct order.
This website is a tool to help you do that. It has all the pages of the book in "cards" that you can drag and drop into whatever order you like. To save your order, click the "Save" button. The order is saved in your browser's local storage, so it will be there when you come back to the site.
There is a sidebar where you can write notes about the book. These are also saved in your browser's local storage.
This website is a work in progress! If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
