The Cain's Jawbone is a 100-page book. The paragraphs are not in order, and the book is not paginated. The challenge is to read the book in the correct order.
This website is a tool to help you do that. It has all the pages of the book in "cards" that you can <b> drag and drop </b> into whatever order you like or <b> swap </b> them by right-clicking. 
To save the order of cards, click the save button. The order is saved in your browser's local storage, so it should be there when you come back to the site.
There is a sidebar where you can write notes about the book, accessed by clicking on the notes button. These are also saved in your browser's local storage.
You can label the cards by changing their colour. This is useful for grouping cards together, or for marking cards that you have read.
Hope this helps you solve the puzzle!
